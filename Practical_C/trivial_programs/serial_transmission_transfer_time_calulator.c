*	Name:	 Serial Transmission Line Transfer Time Calculator		*
*										*
*	Author:	 Steven Nava							*
*										*
*	Purpose: A trivial program to calulate how long it would take to	*
*		 transfer a file of a given size using a serial trasmission	*
*		 line.								*
*		 								*
*	Usage:	 Run program and enter in a size and unit of measurement.	*
*		 Program will calulate how long it would take to transfer	*
*		 a file of given size at max speed through a serial 		*
*		 transmission line.						*
*										*
*	Notes:	 A serial tramsmission line can transfer 960 characters		*
*		 per minute. We will assume that 1 character equals 1 byte.	*
