Date Calculator code design

Code design done in pseudo-code

Loop
	print menu
	prompt for selection
	read in selection
	if selection is calculate days between two dates
		prompt for date 1
		read in date 1 input
		input validation
		prompt for date 2
		read in date 2 input
		input validation
		store the year value for date 1 into a year variable
		store the year value for date 2 into a year variable
		store the month value for date 1 into a month variable
		store the month value for date 2 into a month variable
		store the date value for date 1 into a date variable
		store the date value for date 2 into a date variable
		determine if year values are the same
		if year values are the same
			determine if the month values are the same
			if the month values are the same
				subtract the date values
				if result less than 0 multiply by -1
			else
				subtract date value from month number of days to get total number of days
				add 1 to month 1 variable
				While Loop current month is less than month 2
					add month number of days for current month to total number of days
					add 1 to current month
				End Loop
				add date value to total number of days
		else 
			subtract date value from month number of days to get total number of days
			add 1 to month 1 variable
			While Loop current year value is less than year 2
				While Loop current month is less than month 12
					add month number of days for current month to total number of days
					add 1 to current month
				End Loop
			End Loop
			While Loop current month is less than month 2
				add month number of days for current month to total number of days
				add 1 to current month
			End Loop
			add date value to total number of days
		print total number of days
	end if
