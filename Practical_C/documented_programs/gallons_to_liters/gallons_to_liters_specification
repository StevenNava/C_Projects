This is a preliminary specification.

Gallons to Liters is a program that allows the user to convert any number
of gallons, inlcuding partial gallons, to liters. The program will use
the formula (1 gallon = 3.78541178 liters) to perform the conversion.

When the program is run, it will prompt the user to enter in the amount
of gallons that they would like to be converted. It will then print out the
number of liters that corresponds to the entered in amount of gallons.

Example:
	Enter in the number of gallons to be converted to liters: 1.5
	
	The number of liters equivalent to 1.5 gallons is approximately 5.69 liters.
